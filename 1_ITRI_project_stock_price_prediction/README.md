# Stock price prediction
This is my independent study in ITRI Data Analyst Training Program.\
The goal is to have a stock price trend prediction via machine learning algos and use the prediction to back test the performance.\
The result shows the selected model can beat market.

You may see the presentation slides to have an overview of the study, or dive into my jupyter notebook for the coding details.
