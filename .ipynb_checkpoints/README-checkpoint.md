# Finance
In this section, I developed several tools related to financial management.
The goal is to help myself have a better control of my capital and even gain premium versus market.

Now we have:
1. Stock price prediction (using ML algorithms to predict stock trend (works for symbol 'VOO' already)
2. Dollar Cost Averaging strategy (DCA, given specific symbol, time frame, cycle (day, week or month etc.) initial amount and periodic cash in amount, return the ROI & IRR)
3. Best MA strategy finding (heatmap with respective performance matrix) + yealy MA performance
4. Rebalancing stretagy
5. Overall portfolio performance simulation
6. Useful functions (beta / IRR calculators etc.)

Future works:
1. Enhance stock price prediction model (feature engineering, model tuning)
2. Find a robust overall portfolio by going through each strategy / target and their combination
